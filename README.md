# 📡 Network Selection Project

This project explores and implements various decision-making techniques to select the most optimal network in a heterogeneous environment (e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G). It serves as a reference for students and researchers studying network optimization and intelligent decision systems.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In today's wireless environments, users often encounter multiple networks with differing quality. Choosing the best network (based on signal, speed, cost, delay, etc.) requires structured decision-making. This project models that problem using mathematical, statistical, and AI-based techniques.
